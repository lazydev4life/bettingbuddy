bet with your buddy about everything 
this is a hobby project done by someone with zero experience, if it will be ever done and you want to use it, pls use it inside a private network, I will not be responible if you use this to comunicate on the internet, the packets are not encrypted, there is no authentication, the model is a server-client, you will have to have to manually change your IP for now, it's outside the scope of this project to make the program to change it
